This code will detect a cat by using a basic webcamera and tell users if there is a cat present or not present.
Required hardware: some kind of cat tower or shelf to attach/perch the camera onto, jetson orin nano using jetpack version 6, and we used a logitech C270 webcamera which worked with the code. We also used an AVerMedia camera and that worked as well.
